# Microsoft and NASA's project 
## Learning how to classify rocks with AI

The project contains:
* An introduction to Python Notebooks in VS Code
* How to read a file and manage that data with python
* The creation of an AI that is trained to classify rocks from a given folder with images of those types of rocks

***

This particular project was created fully in vscode and instead of using anaconda to manage all the python modules, a virtual environment was created from python:3.8.5 and configured to run those packages, you can find them all in `/rock-recognition/requirements.txt`

The libraries used in this project are:
* pandas
* jupyter
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* keras
* torch
* torchvision

But you can easily install them from the terminal (after activating your virtual environment- recommended) with the following command  
`pip3 install -r ./rock-recognition/requirements.txt`
